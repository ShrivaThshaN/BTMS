This is  a basic purely functional Temperature monitoring system for the reactor at which gets data from the 256 thermocouples installed around the reactor's vessel and the main idea is to pop up alerts when the delta T is more than a threshold value

The Data value is set to be refreshed at particular intervals

This doesnt focus much on the aesthetics part since this  mainly focuses on purely functional working of data visibility , data rendering and alert generation.
